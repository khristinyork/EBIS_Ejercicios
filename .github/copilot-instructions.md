# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
- This project structure is currently empty or not yet initialized. No source files, documentation, or configuration files were found.
- Before contributing, check with the project owner for the intended architecture, workflows, and conventions.

## General Guidance
- If you are initializing the project, follow best practices for your chosen language/framework.
- Place build scripts, configuration, and documentation in standard locations (e.g., `README.md`, `src/`, `tests/`, etc.).
- Document any non-standard decisions or workflows as the project evolves.

## When the Codebase Grows
- Update this file to reflect:
  - Major components and their responsibilities
  - Build/test/debug workflows
  - Project-specific conventions
  - Integration points and external dependencies
- Reference key files and directories as examples.

_This file will guide AI agents to be productive as the codebase evolves. Please update it as the project structure and conventions become clear._
